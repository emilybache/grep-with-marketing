    Fakes generated from: errors.txt

    Generated file to help to quickly stub C++ undefined external functions.

    * Add this file to your test build.
    * One at a time
      * Uncomment an exploing fake function definition.
      * Add needed the include file.
      * Modify non-void function return types and propvide a return value.
      * Fix errors.
      * Work carefully. Use the compiler and link error output to test your changes.

    * You could customize the BOOM macros to only fail the test, rather than exit the
      test runner.
